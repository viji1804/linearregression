# linearregression
This project predicts house prices using linear regression based on features like total rooms, bedrooms, and households. We use a dataset from Kaggle, preprocess it to handle missing values, and split it into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is then trained and evaluated, providing insights into the relationship between the selected features and house prices.
